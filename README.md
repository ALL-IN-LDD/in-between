# In + BETween

The In + BETween card game, also known as "Acey-Deucey" or "Red Dog," is a competitive player-to-player gambling game that blends luck and strategy. Players aim to predict whether the value of a third card will fall between the values of two face-up cards dealt by the dealer. After the two cards are revealed, players can choose to either go all in, place their bets on the outcome or pass the round. If the third cardâ€™s value falls within the range, the player wins; otherwise, they lose. The game features special rules for tied cards or consecutive values. Easy to learn and play, "In-Between" is a fun and fast-paced game enjoyed in casual or gambling settings.
